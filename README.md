## 🧠 Bailey Koo's 3D Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive personal portfolio! Built with React, Three.js, and Vite, this site is a fusion of storytelling, strategy, and mathematics. It showcases who I am—from math olympiad kid to software engineer to competitive board game player—with just the right amount of flair.

## 🧠 Inspiration & Themes

This site reflects my lifelong love for math, problem solving, and structured creativity—whether through research, quant trading, or games like *Splendor* and *Chess*. It's meant to be both personal and technical, like a good proof or a well-played hand.
